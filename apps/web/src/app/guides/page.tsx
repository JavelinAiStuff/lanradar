Requirements: sufficient power outlets (at least 300W per seat), adequate cooling/ventilation, accessible location with parking, strong cellular signal for backup, loading dock for equipment, and 24-hour access if overnight. Community halls, sports halls, and convention centers work well. Visit venues in person — photos lie. Check power capacity with the venue manager and get it in writing.`,

    content: `The network is your most critical infrastructure. For small LANs (<50): quality consumer switch and router. For medium (50-200): managed switches, proper DHCP server, VLANs for gaming vs general traffic. For large (200+): enterprise-grade switches, redundant uplinks, dedicated network team, QoS policies. Always have a dedicated DHCP server — never rely on a consumer router for 100+ devices. Bring spare cables and switches. Test everything 24 hours before doors open.`,

Use established tournament platforms (Challonge, start.gg) for brackets. Have clear rules published in advance. Prizes don't need to be expensive — trophies, peripherals, or even just bragging rights work. Schedule finals during peak hours for maximum hype.`,

Partner with local gaming communities, Discord servers, and streamer. Early bird ticket pricing creates urgency. Create a Discord server for your event — it becomes your primary communication channel. After the event, share photos, highlights, and thank attendees. The post-event community is your pre-marketing for next time.`,
